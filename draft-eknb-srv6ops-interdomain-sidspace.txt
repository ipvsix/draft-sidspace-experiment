     SID Space (5f00::/16) Inter-domain Addressing Recommendations
             draft-eknb-srv6ops-interdomain-sidspace-latest

Abstract

   This specification recommends a specific structured use of the SRv6
   SIDs prefix in support of Inter-Domain SRv6 networks.  The core of
   the proposal is to structure the address space by Autonomous System
   Number (ASN).

   Use of this proposed structure is entirely voluntary.  Voluntary use
   of this structure aids SRv6 operations while preserving the ability
   to use this prefix across cooperating SRv6 domains, but not across
   the general Internet.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC9602] requested of IANA a dedicated prefix for Segment Routing
   over IPv6 [RFC8402] Segment Identifiers (SRv6 SIDs), with the aim of
   "improv[ing] security by making it simpler to filter traffic at the
   edge of the SR domains."  The prefix 5f00::/16 was allocated for this
   purpose [IANA-IPv6Special].  No requirements were placed on the use
   of this prefix nor any recommendations made for structured use of
   this prefix.

   This specification recommends a specific structured use of the SRv6
   SIDs prefix in support of Inter-Domain SRv6 networks.  The core of
   the proposal is to structure the address space by Autonomous System
   Number (ASN).

   Use of this proposed structure is entirely voluntary.  Voluntary use
   of this structure aids SRv6 operations while preserving the ability
   to use this prefix across cooperating SRv6 domains, but not across
   the general Internet.

   The SID space prefix was allocated to improve ease of filtering.
   Where SRv6 traffic using these prefixes may be shared with
   cooperating partner networks, this proposal makes it easier to craft
   filters that permit only SRv6 traffic from identified ASNs.

   As a point of historical interest, this proposal contains echos of
   the structure of the original 6bone test allocation [RFC1897].

2.  Inter-domain SRv6 SIDs

   An inter-domain SRv6 SID, as used in this document, means an SRv6 SID
   from the address space used by one SRv6 domain that is advertised to
   another SRv6 domain force inclusion an SRv6 Policy used by the second
   domain when forwarding policy-specific traffic to the advertising
   SRv6 domain.

3.  Proposed Structure

   The recommendation of this specification is for SRv6 domains to
   allocate SIDs from prefixes that are concatenations of the SRv6 SID
   prefix (5f00::/16) and an applicable ASN.  Assuming 32-bit ASNs, this
   yields a /48 per ASN in use within an SRv6 domain, i.e. 5f00:as-
   hi16:as-lo16::/48.

3.1.  Generation of ASN derived SRv6 prefix SID

   Each unique ASN generates a prefix from the IANA allocation by
   converting mutually agreed upon ASNs to hexidecimal, and inserting
   this hex into a /48 prefix.

3.1.1.  SRv6 SID Documentation Prefixes

   Using 16-bit and 32-bit ASNs reserved for documentation purposes
   [IANA-ASNs] yields several SRv6 SID prefixes that might be used for
   SRv6 documentation purposes.  These prefixes presently include ASNs
   in the range of 64496-64511 as defined in [RFC5398]:

   5f00:0:fbf0::/48
   ...
   5f00:0:fbff::/48

   or any /48 prefix between these.

   It should be noted that 32-but ASNs do not have a specific range
   dedicated for documentation but do have a private use block as
   defined in [RFC6996].

3.1.2.  SRv6 SID Private Use Prefixes

   Using 16-bit and 32-bit ASNs reserved for private use purposes
   [IANA-ASNs] and defined by yields several SRv6 SID prefixes for
   private use.  These prefixes are defined by RFC 6996 and presently
   include:

                   +==========+=======================+
                   | ASN size | Private Use Range     |
                   +==========+=======================+
                   | 16-bit   | 64512-65534           |
                   +----------+-----------------------+
                   | 32-bit   | 4200000000-4294967294 |
                   +----------+-----------------------+

                                 Table 1

   yielding:

   5f00:0:fc00::/48
   ...
   5f00:0:fffe::/48

   and

   5f00:fa56:ea00::/48
   ...
   5f00:ffff:fffe::/48

   or any /48 prefix between these, as private use ASN-derived SID
   prefixes.

4.  Routing and Filtering

   As noted in [draft-bdmgct-spring-srv6-security], it is assumed that
   each ASN using this SRv6 SID space structure has deployed their
   respective SRv6 implementations within a limited domain [RFC8799]
   with appropriate filtering at the domain boundaries.  Because this is
   intended for inter-domain use, the requisite filtering exceptions
   must be made between each SRv6 domain to allow for the desired Inter-
   Domain communication to occur.  Care should be taken to allow only
   the desired and necessary communication between each SRv6 domain.
   The mechanisms used should be conformant with the given domain's
   security policy and may include, but are not limited to:

   *  routing filters such as BGP prefix-lists, route-maps, route-
      policies, or other analogous mechanisms, or

   *  access control filters at the domain edge

5.  Example test case

   One possible test case is the exchange of the IPv6 prefix SID between
   two autonomous systems with independent management domains.  In this
   example, AS4294967294 exchanges their SRv6 SID prefix
   (5f00:ffff:fffe::/48) with AS4200000000 who announces their ASN
   derived SRv6 SID prefix (5f00:fa56:ea00::/48).

  └─────────────────────────────────┘           └──────────────────────────────────┘

   Within this structure, appropriate and agreed upon policy may be
   shared between the partner ASNs.  Defining the policy or use cases is
   outside of the scope of this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the inherent security posture of SRv6
   [RFC8402], [RFC8754].  The SID space prefix was allocated to improve
   ease of filtering.  Where SRv6 traffic using these prefixes may be
   shared with cooperating partner networks, this proposal makes it
   easier to craft filters that permit only SRv6 traffic from identified
   ASNs.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
