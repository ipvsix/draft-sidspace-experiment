Abstract

   This specification proposes an experimental structure for use of the
   SRv6 SIDs prefix in support of Inter-domain SRv6 networks.  The core
   of the proposal is to structure the address space by Autonomous
   System Number (ASN).

   Use of this proposed structure is entirely voluntary.  The goal of
   this experiment is to aid SRv6 operations while preserving the
   ability to use this prefix across cooperating SRv6 domains, but not
   across the general Internet.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-6man-sids] requested of IANA a dedicated prefix for Segment
   Routing over IPv6 [RFC8402] Segment Identifiers (SRv6 SIDs), with the
   aim of "improv[ing] security by making it simpler to filter traffic
   at the edge of the SR domains."  The prefix 5f00::/16 was allocated
   for this purpose [IANA-IPv6Special].  No requirements were placed on
   the use of this prefix nor any recommendations made for structured
   use of this prefix.

   This specification proposes an experimental structure for use of the
   SRv6 SIDs prefix in support of Inter-domain SRv6 networks.  The core
   of the proposal is to structure the address space by Autonomous
   System Number (ASN).

   Use of this proposed structure is entirely voluntary.  The goal is to
   aid SRv6 operations while preserving the ability to use this prefix
   across cooperating SRv6 domains, but not across the general Internet.

   The SID space prefix was allocated to improve ease of filtering.
   Where SRv6 traffic using these prefixes may be shared with
   cooperating partner networks, this proposal makes it easier to craft
   filters that permit only SRv6 traffic from identified ASNs.

   As a point of historical interest, this proposal contains echos of
   the structure of the original 6bone test allocation [RFC1897].

2.  Proposed Structure

   The recommendation of this specification is for SRv6 domains to
   allocate SIDs from prefixes that are concatenations of the SRv6 SID
   prefix (5f00::/16) and an applicable ASN.  Assuming 32-bit ASNs, this
   yields a /48 per ASN in use within an SRv6 domain, i.e.
   5f00:as.hi16:as.lo16::/48.

2.1.  SRv6 SID Documentation Prefixes

   Using 16-bit and 32-bit ASNs reserved for documentation purposes
   [IANA-ASNs] yields several SRv6 SID prefixes that might be used for
   SRv6 documentation purposes.  These prefixes presently include ASNs
   in the range of 64496-64511 as defined in [RFC5398]:

   5f00:0:fbf0::/48
   ...
   5f00:0:fbff::/48
   ...
   5f00:0:fbfe::/48

   Or any combination thereof.

   It should be noted that 32-but ASNs do not have a specific range
   dedicated for documentation but do have a private use block as
   defined in [RFC6996].

2.2.  SRv6 SID Private Use Prefixes

   Using 16-bit and 32-bit ASNs reserved for private use purposes
   [IANA-ASNs] and defined by yields several SRv6 SID prefixes for
   private use.  These prefixes are defined by RFC 6996 and presently
   include:

   64512-65534 16-bit 4200000000-4294967294 32-bit

   5f00:0:fc00::/48
   ...
   5f00:fa56:ea00::/48
   ...
   5f00:ffff:fffe::/48

   Or any combination thereof.

3.  Evaluating the Experiment

   Evaluation of the results will determine the ease of deployment and
   operation, or lack thereof and will inform if further work can be
   performed to improve ease of implementation and operation.

   A survey of experiences of those SRv6 domain operators that opted to
   participate should be undertaken, and results published.  Feedback
   highlighting ease of SID allocation or management, improved security
   through ease of filtering, etc. may all point towards a successful
   experiment.

   As use of the structure proposed here is entirely voluntary, lack of
   adoption will clearly indicate a failed experiment.  Understanding
   the reasons for lack of adoption may prove helpful should any further
   experiments of this sort be undertaken.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the inherent security posture of SRv6
   [RFC8402], [RFC8754].  The SID space prefix was allocated to improve
   ease of filtering.  Where SRv6 traffic using these prefixes may be
   shared with cooperating partner networks, this proposal makes it
   easier to craft filters that permit only SRv6 traffic from identified
   ASNs.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
