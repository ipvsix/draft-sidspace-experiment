Abstract

   This specification proposes an experimental structure for use of the
   SRv6 SIDs prefix in support of Inter-domain SRv6 networks.  The core
   of the proposal is to structure the address space by Autonomous
   System Number (ASN).

   Use of this proposed structure is entirely voluntary.  The goal is to
   aid SRv6 operations while preserving the ability to use this prefix
   across cooperating SRv6 domains, but not across the general Internet.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.ietf-6man-sids] requested of IANA a dedicated prefix for Segment
   Routing over IPv6 [RFC8402] Segment Identifiers (SRv6 SIDs), with the
   aim of "improv[ing] security by making it simpler to filter traffic
   at the edge of the SR domains."  The prefix 5f00::/16 was allocated
   for this purpose ([IANA-IPv6Special]).  No requirements were placed
   on the use of this prefix nor any recommendations made for structured
   use of this prefix.

   This specification proposes an experiemental structure for use of the
   SRv6 SIDs prefix in support of Inter-domain SRv6 networks.  The core
   of the proposal is to structure the address space by Autonomous
   System Number (ASN).

   Use of this proposed structure is entirely voluntary.  The goal is to
   aid SRv6 operations while preserving the ability to use this prefix
   across cooperating SRv6 domains, but not across the general Internet.

   The SID space prefix was allocated to improve ease of filtering.
   Where SRv6 traffic using these prefixes may be shared with
   cooperating partner networks, this proposal makes it easier to craft
   filters that permit only SRv6 traffic from identified ASNs.

   As a point of historical interest, this proposal contains echos of
   the structure of the original 6bone test allocation ([RFC1897]).

2.  Proposed Structure

   The recommendation of this specification is for SRv6 domains to
   allocate SIDs from prefixes that are concatenations of the SRv6 SID
   prefix (5f00::/16) and an applicable ASN.  Assuming 32-bit ASNs, this
   yields a /48 per ASN in use within an SRv6 domain, i.e.
   5f00:<as.hi16>:<as.lo16>::/48.

2.1.  SRv6 SID Documentation Prefixes

   Using 16-bit and 32-bit ASNs reserved for documentation purposes
   ([IANA-ASNs]) yields several SRv6 SID prefixes that might be used for
   SRv6 documentation purposes.  These prefixes presently include: ...

2.2.  SRv6 SID Private Use Prefixes

   Using 16-bit and 32-bit ASNs reserved for private use purposes
   ([IANA-ASNs]) yields several SRv6 SID prefixes for private use.
   These prefixes presently include: ...

3.  Evaluating the Experiment

   Evaluation of the success of this experiment should be done in two
   parts.  First, operators who have opted not to try it should be
   surveyed to understand why not.  Answers that draw attention to
   technical or operational concerns are of particular interest (as
   opposed to just "not interested").

   Second, a survey of experiences of those SRv6 domain operators that
   opted to try it should be undertaken.  Feedback highlighting ease of
   SID allocation or management, improved security through ease of
   filtering, etc. may all point towards a successful experiment.

   As use of the structure proposed here is entirely voluntary, lack of
   adoption will clearly indicate a failed experiment.  Understanding
   the reasons for lack of adoption may prove helpful should any further
   experiments of this sort be undertaken.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document does not alter the inherent security posture of SRv6
   ([RFC8402], [RFC8754]).  The SID space prefix was allocated to
   improve ease of filtering.  Where SRv6 traffic using these prefixes
   may be shared with cooperating partner networks, this proposal makes
   it easier to craft filters that permit only SRv6 traffic from
   identified ASNs.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
